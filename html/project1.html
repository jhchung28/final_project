            <p>The Moriyama House is a residential building located in Tokyo, Japan. It was designed by the Japanese architect Ryue Nishizawa. The building is a collection of ten individual units that are connected by a series of outdoor walkways and courtyards.</p>

            <p>On the ships, these containers can be stacked up to 9 units high. This image is an iteration of a home design that I modeled.</p>

            <p>I made three-dimensional representations of the shipping containers. The width and the height of each container remained the same at 8ft by 8.5ft respectively. The length of the containers were 40ft, 20ft, and 10ft. </p>
